# Django State Attractions Project

This Django project presents a user-friendly interface to explore tourist attractions across various states. The homepage displays a clear table listing attractions, their respective states, and a clickable "State Details" link for each state. Clicking on this link redirects the user to a dedicated page showcasing all attractions within the selected state.

## Key Features:

    Intuitive Homepage: A well-structured table provides a quick overview of attractions and their associated states.
    Interactive State Details: Clicking on "State Details" leads to a detailed page listing all attractions within that state.
    User-Friendly Design: The project prioritizes a clean and visually appealing user interface.
    Efficient Data Management: Django's robust framework ensures seamless data handling and presentation.

I had a lot of fun learning the template structure for Django. I'm interested in practicing more how to utilize SQLite and models!
